# SI 364 - W18 - HW4

### DEADLINE: tba

## Overview

You've been provided some scaffolding code. On top of the provided code, you'll need to add a number of things to practice, each marked by `TODO 364` inside the `app.py` file.

* Associating data with a user's login using database relationships (and migrations)
* Building and using many-to-many relationships
* Practicing using SQLAlchemy for database queries and dealing with query results
* Building functions for the `get_or_create` operation that work with a database structure that includes many-to-many relationships
* All aspects of a "CRUD" (Create Read Update Delete) application, focusing on the Update and Delete operations

## Instructions

* First, check out the **to submit** instructions so you know how to begin work on this!
* Check out `app.py` and complete the `TODO 364` todo items one by one.
* Make sure to debug along the way!
* Then ensure you have everything committed and pushed to your new GitHub repo to submit the link properly to Canvas. *Again, see below for specific submission instructions.*

## To submit (read ALL the below before beginning)

**Don't fork this one.** Download the link as a .zip file. Unzip the file so you have all the provided, included files in a directory on your computer.

Then, just as you did for the midterm assignment, create a GitHub repository for HW4 on your account called `HW4_364`. (It must be called this to be graded.)

You may create a private repository if you want, and if you do that, you **must also add all three of us instructors as collaborators to your repository. Otherwise we will not be able to see and grade it**. Everything else remains the same.

**[Here](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-a-student-developer-pack/)** is how to get a GitHub student developer pack so you can have unlimited private repositories. (The student developer pack also includes access to a bunch of other useful/fun software tools! It is free for all students; follow the instructions at that link.)

Push *all* of the code files, including any additional files you add and all included files, to this GitHub repository.

[Check out the midterm instructions](https://github.com/SI364-Winter2018/Midterm-Instructions) for a reminder of how to add all 3 of us instructors (Jackie, Mauli, Sonakshi) as collaborators to the repository you submit.

Submit the link to your GitHub repository on the Canvas assignment for HW4. It should take the form of: `https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/HW4_364`
